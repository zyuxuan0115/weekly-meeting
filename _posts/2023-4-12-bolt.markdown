### Conclusion from vimdiff 2 do_work's assembly code
- ![screenshot3](/assets/2023-04-12/s3.png)
- The version that have `do_work` moved by BOLT doesn't reorder BB
    + It just deletes `NOP`s
    + In BOLT's paper, they also mentioned such feature in BOLT's optimization pass
    + ![screenshot1](/assets/2023-04-12/s1.png)
- I discovered that there is a pass called [RemoveNops::runOnFunction(BinaryFunction &BF)](https://github.com/upenn-acg/BOLT/blob/pg2/func-reloc/bolt/lib/Passes/BinaryPasses.cpp#L1828)
    + to disable this pass, we need to comment out `Manager.registerPass(std::make_unique<RemoveNops>(NeverPrint));` [here](https://github.com/upenn-acg/BOLT/blob/pg2/func-reloc/bolt/lib/Rewrite/BinaryPassManager.cpp#L340) in `Rewrite/BinaryPassManager.cpp` 
    + however, it doesn't work! `NOP`s are still deleted by BOLT!
    + so I disable all registered passes.



- [BinaryContext::hasValidCodePadding()](https://github.com/upenn-acg/BOLT/blob/pg2/func-reloc/bolt/lib/Core/BinaryContext.cpp#L836) has a closure [skipZeros](https://github.com/upenn-acg/BOLT/blob/pg2/func-reloc/bolt/lib/Core/BinaryContext.cpp#L869)

- In [if(BC.MIB->isNoop(Instruction))](https://github.com/upenn-acg/BOLT/blob/pg2/func-reloc/bolt/lib/Core/BinaryFunction.cpp#L1411), it says
```
NOTE: disassembly loses the correct size information for noops.
       E.g. nopw 0x0(%rax,%rax,1) is 9 bytes, but re-encoded it's only
       5 bytes. Preserve the size info using annotations.
```

- [here](https://github.com/upenn-acg/BOLT/blob/pg2/func-reloc/bolt/lib/Core/BinaryFunction.cpp#L1202) is how BOLT reads binary instrucitons from a given binary

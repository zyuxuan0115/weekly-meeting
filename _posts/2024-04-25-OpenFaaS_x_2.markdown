### Finish converting SocialNetwork to serverless
#### Done
- tested the functionality for inputs

#### Remained
- all RPCs are synchronized
- all accesses to data store (mongodb, redis, memcached) are synchronized 

#### Question
- should we make the function call like the original microservice?


### The possible issue for deploying 2 openfaas runtime

### What do we want to achieve?
#### Performance improvement?

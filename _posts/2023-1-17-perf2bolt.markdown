### The performance of modified perf2bolt
- The modified `perf2bolt` is tooooo slow.
    + the result is for each LBR record it needs 4 lookup (binary search)!
        * the 1st one is to get the starting address of function for a <strong>branch source</strong> instruction
        * the 2nd one is to get the Basic Block for a  <strong>branch source</strong> instruction's offset
        * the 3rd one is to get the starting address of function for a  <strong>branch target</strong> instruction
        * the 4th one is to get the Basic Block for a  <strong>branch target</strong> instruction's offset
    + we have tons of LBR records
        * this is the number of LBR records when I ran perf record for just 3 seconds!
        * ![rew_result](/assets/2023-01-15/new_result.png)
    + my current solution to solve this problem 
        * before performing the 4 binary searches, we first check if the address is less than `0x4400000`

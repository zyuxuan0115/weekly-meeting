### Serverless function
- Serverless function
	+ 
- cold start vs. warm start
	+ warm start: 
		* function in memory?
		* function in container (or VM) and container is loaded to the server?
	+ cold start:
		* function not in memory?
		* function not in container, nor is container loaded to the server?
- step functions and drvier functions
	+ defines how to stitch serverless functions 
	+ can we check the invocation of step function or driver functions to know the call graph of serverless functions
- stateful serverless function
	+ why do we need the serverless function to be stateful
		* the serverless functions write to persistent memory
		* need to have a log since the write might fail
		* need a log in case there is any 
- build call graph
	+ motivation

### Profile
- Can Intel LBR profile the execution of programs in containers (VM)
- Can Intel LBR profile the non-C/C++ programs?
- currently Ocolos can only change the code layout of C/C++ functions
	+ need to check whether BOLT supports non-C/C++ functions
	+ I guess it can since it operates functions at MCInst (close to machine code) level

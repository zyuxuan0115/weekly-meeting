### turn LLVM version BOLT into lite mode?
- When I add `--lite` to `llvm-bolt`, it reports the following warning and refuses to enable lite mode. :( 
```
BOLT-WARNING: split function detected on input : _ZL28delete_dictionary_tablespacev.cold/1. The support is limited in relocation mode
BOLT-WARNING: disabling lite mode (-lite) when split functions are present
[tracer] 67427 functions was moved (functions reordered) by BOLT
[tracer(time)] llvm-bolt took 33.795486 seconds to execute
```  
- So BOLT spent 33.8 seconds moving 67427 functions, which is reported by Ocolos

- However, for Facebook BOLT, the output shows that BOLT spent 6.805391 seconds moving 1202 functions.
```
BOLT-WARNING: split function detected on input : _ZL28delete_dictionary_tablespacev.cold/1. The support is limited in relocation mode.
BOLT-WARNING: Ignored 0 functions due to cold fragments.
[tracer] 1202 functions was moved (functions reordered) by BOLT

### Fix the 2.2% traces mismatching disassembled function contents issue

- <strong>case 3 (profile collected from ocolos C0 round)</strong>
    + first, in <strong>C0</strong> round, Ocolos builds a BOLTed binary <strong>A</strong> from original mysqld binary with `oltp_read_only` as input
    + then, Ocolos performs code replacement and enters <strong>C1</strong> round
    + then, Ocolos collects profile <strong>P</strong> of `oltp_read_only` with `mysqld` which has code layout replaced by Ocolos. 
    + then shutdown `Ocolos` + `mysqld`
    + then, offline produce a new BOLTed binary <strong>B</strong> based on <strong>A</strong> and <strong>P</strong>
    + finally, measure `oltp_read_only`on <strong>B</strong>'s performance
    + There is also a comparison <strong>B'</strong> where perf2bolt's traces mismatching disassembled function contents is <strong>43%</strong> (a.k.a. we didn't change any address in the profile read by perf2bolt
    + <strong>B</strong> & <strong>B'</strong> use the same profile

### Next step 
- fix the issue caused in this figure
![code_layout](/assets/2023-01-19/new_illegal.png)
- check if `perf2bolt` can create the BOLTed text section at any location
   + 
```
BOLT-INFO: first alloc address is 0x200000
BOLT-INFO: creating new program header table at address 0x4400000, offset 0x4200000
```
    + Can BOLT create the new BOLTed text section at a new location that is not overlap with the old BOLTed text section?
    + If we can move BOLTed text section to any location we want, discuss about how to perform continuous optimization
- improve `Ocolos`'s performance on cascade52

| average | 5603.195 | 7587.378 | 7978.186 | 9060.358 | 

- check if there is a way to change the location of <strong>heap</strong>
   + to debug `perf2bolt`, I moved ocolos to `acggpu1`. 
   + on `acggpu1` it also has the problem that the BOLTed text section overlap with the heap 
- last time we discussed that you will assign me some new paper to write review

### paper

- revised section 3 & 4
	+ now section 3 only 5 pages

### pg2 on pagerank

- profile with max frequency + longer duration
	+ pg2 works with more workloads
	+ overall performance of the workload doesn't get worse
	+ should we increase the profile duration to see if we can get pg2 work with more inputs?

### randacc

- execution time of randacc on the cascade varies greatly
- test 5 times and compute the average

### performance over time graph

- now it's pagerank + roadNet-PA

### next steps
- understand why APT-GET cannot insert prefetch to bfs
	+ need Saba's help
- write section 5: evaluation
	+ measure pg2's execution time
		* might need to debug pg2/BOLT if bugs occur
	+ measure LLC MPKI
	+ measure dynamic instruction count
